# VPN Functionality Improvements Update

## DNS Fixes Implemented

1. **Enhanced IP Range Detection**
   - Now properly detects and supports 10.244.*.* and 10.216.48.* IP ranges in addition to 10.21.*.*
   - Improved logging for specific VPN network ranges

2. **DNS Resolution Fixes**
   - Added VPN gateway as primary DNS server (common VPN setup pattern)
   - Reordered DNS servers for better reliability (1.1.1.1 first, as it's generally faster)
   - Added proper DNS options for faster failover and retry

3. **systemd-resolved Enhancements**
   - Added more configuration options (DNSOverTLS, cache settings, DNSSEC options)
   - Explicitly set DNS servers for the VPN interface
   - Added DNS cache flushing to ensure fresh resolution

4. **resolv.conf Improvements**
   - Added more resolver options (timeout, attempts, rotate, edns0)
   - Added search domains to help with internal DNS resolution
   - Fixed nsswitch.conf integration to ensure DNS lookups are properly handled

5. **New DNS Troubleshooting Tools**
   - Enhanced DNS testing with multiple methods (host, ping, dig)
   - Better diagnostic output to identify specific DNS issues
   - Added new dedicated `fix_vpn_dns.sh` script for DNS-specific troubleshooting

## How to Fix Persistent DNS Issues

If you continue to experience DNS resolution problems after connecting to the VPN:

1. Run the new DNS fix script: `sudo ./fix_vpn_dns.sh`
   - This script focuses specifically on fixing DNS resolution issues
   - It configures both systemd-resolved and direct resolv.conf as needed

2. Check nsswitch.conf: `cat /etc/nsswitch.conf`
   - Make sure the "hosts:" line includes "dns"
   - Should look like: `hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns myhostname`

3. If using systemd-resolved, verify status: `resolvectl status`
   - The VPN interface should show the correct DNS servers

4. For network configuration issues beyond DNS, use: `sudo ./fix_vpn_connection.sh`

## Next Steps for Testing

1. Reconnect to your VPN
2. Run `sudo ./fix_vpn_dns.sh` to apply the DNS-specific fixes
3. Test DNS resolution with: `host google.com` or `ping cloudflare.com`
4. Use `sudo ./test_vpn_ranges.sh` to verify all IP ranges work properly
