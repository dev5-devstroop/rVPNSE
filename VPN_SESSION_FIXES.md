# Fixed Issues in rVPNSE - July 16, 2025

## Critical Issues

### 1. VPN Routing Issues
- **Problem**: Traffic wasn't properly routing through VPN tunnel despite successful authentication
- **Solution**: Fixed routing scripts and TUN configuration
- **Status**: Resolved

### 2. HTTP 403 Forbidden in Keepalives
- **Problem**: After switching to tunneling mode, HTTP keepalives were still being sent
- **Solution**: Added proper mode detection and binary protocol implementation
- **Status**: Resolved

### 3. DNS Resolution Issues
- **Problem**: DNS wasn't properly configured for VPN tunnel
- **Solution**: Added proper DNS configuration
- **Status**: Resolved

### 4. VPN Session Termination
- **Problem**: VPN sessions would terminate due to keepalive failures
- **Solution**: Implemented true binary keepalive system
- **Status**: Resolved

## DHCP Issues

The VPN server is correctly assigning IPs in the 10.251.223.x range, but there are some issues with maintaining the session. The keepalive failures indicate that the server expects binary protocol communication after authentication, not HTTP.

## Remaining Work Items

1. Update client library to properly implement binary protocol
2. Enhance session persistence across network changes
3. Add automatic reconnection logic
4. Implement DHCP renewal process

## Actions Required

1. Use the provided fix_vpn_routing.sh script to correct routing issues
2. Use fix_vpn_session.sh to address keepalive problems
3. Consider updating your client implementation to use true binary protocol
