# VPN Functionality Fixes

## Fixes Implemented

1. **Fixed Compiler Error (E0716)** - The "temporary value dropped while borrowed" error has been fixed by ensuring longer-lived string values are created before operations that borrow from them.

2. **Fixed Unused Variable Warning** - Removed unused index variable in the for loop when parsing network connections.

3. **Enhanced Support for Different IP Ranges** - The VPN client now properly handles various IP ranges assigned by DHCP, including:
   - 10.21.*.* range
   - 10.216.48.* range
   - Any other DHCP-assigned range

4. **Improved Split Tunneling** - Added robust split tunneling routes that cover the entire IP space (0.0.0.0/1 and 128.0.0.0/1) while properly excluding the VPN's own subnet.

5. **DNS Resolution** - Enhanced DNS configuration with proper fallbacks for both systemd-resolved and direct resolv.conf editing.

## Testing

To test the VPN functionality with the various IP ranges:

1. Build the project: `cargo build`

2. Connect to your VPN server

3. Run the test script (requires root): `sudo ./test_vpn_ranges.sh`

The test script will:
- Detect the current VPN interface and IP
- Verify if the assigned IP falls in the expected ranges (10.21.*.* or 10.216.48.*)
- Test basic connectivity (ping to 8.8.8.8)
- Test DNS resolution
- Display the routing table and DNS configuration
- Verify split tunneling configuration

## Next Steps

1. Thoroughly test with different servers that assign various IP ranges.

2. Consider fixing the other warnings reported by cargo check (optional).

3. If DNS issues persist, you may need to:
   - Check firewall rules that might block DNS traffic
   - Verify if the VPN server is properly pushing DNS settings
   - Try the `install_vpn_hooks.sh` script to configure DNS properly

4. For any remaining routing issues, use the `fix_vpn_connection.sh` script which repairs common routing problems.
